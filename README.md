# pyrxi-vector

this is a program made exclusively for our system, designed to track our headmates in the most lightweight form we can implement.

when it's further in development, we may do a rewrite to make the code and documentation system-agnostic, but as it stands this is mostly just a personal project we made public for the sake of showing our progress

to-do:

- implement a minimalist CRUD system
