# pyrxi-vector

pyrxi-vector is a program written by our system, for our system. It is the basis of a much larger project we intend on creating when we have more experience.

The program reads from a .csv file, splits off the contents into elements of a vector, and keeps the vector read-only in memory, (eventually) allowing only appended elements to the vector.

The intent is to use this program as a system logging tool without the need of a remote database we don't have control over. While the program itself isn't all that special, the intent behind it, and later projects derived from this template, is important.

# Building

The Makefile is broken, so you're just going to have to wait for us to update it.
